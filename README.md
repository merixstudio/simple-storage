# How to use

Install the package:

```shell
pip install simple-storage
```

Now, depending on the storage you want to use, follow the instructions below.

## File system storage

| Environment variable | Value                                                               |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `STORAGES_BACKEND`   | `storages.backends.file_system.FileSystemStorage`                   |
| `STORAGES_PATH`      | Point to the existing path in your file system, e.g.  `/app/media`. |

## AWS S3 storage

| Environment variable             | Value                                         |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `STORAGES_BACKEND`               | `storages.backends.amazon_s3.AmazonS3Storage` |
| `STORAGES_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | Your AWS access key ID.                       |
| `STORAGES_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Your AWS secret access key.                   |
| `STORAGES_BUCKET_NAME`           | The bucket name that you want to use.         |

> In case you encounter any problems with finding your AWS credentials please read [this page][1] as a reference.

## Google Cloud Storage

| Environment variable                | Value                                                               |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|

| `STORAGES_GOOGLE_CLOUD_CREDENTIALS` | Your Google Cloud Storage credentials in JSON encoded using Base64. |
| `STORAGES_GOOGLE_CLOUD_BUCKET_NAME` | The bucket name that you want to use.                               |

## Localhost setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:merixstudio/simple-storage.git
   ```
2. Enter the `simple-storage` directory:
   ```shell
   cd simple-storage/
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment
    ```shell
    virtualenv .venv
    ```
4. Activate the virtual environment you just created.
    ```shell
   source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
5. Having the virtual environment activated, install required dependencies:
    ```shell
    pip install mypy flake8 pytest pytest-cov pytest-xdist boto3
    ```
6. Set all the required environment variables:
    ```shell
   export STORAGES_BACKEND=storags.backends.file_system.FileSystemStorage
   export STORAGES_PATH=.
   export STORAGES_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=YOURAWSACCESSKEYID
   export STORAGES_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YOURAWSSECRETACCESSKEY
   export STORAGES_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket-name
    ```

## Running tests

To run the tests simply execute the following command:

```shell
pytest -n 5 --cov=storages
```

> **Note:** tests are being run in parallel using [pytest-xdist][3] package. The `-n 5` parameter tells the `pytest-xdist` package how many workers should be spawned to run the tests.

Additionally, a test coverage report would be generated (`--cov=storages` argument).
We are aiming to maintain the **100% test coverage** of this package.

## The workflow

### üíª Start working on the feature or bugfix

1. We expect you to create a branch per each new feature / bugfix.
2. We are not enforcing any specific branch naming convention.
3. Write the code.

### ‚è© Before pushing

1. Auto-format the code using `black` and `isort`:
   ```shell
   black storages/
   isort storages/
   ```
2. Make sure that `flake8` and `mypy` don't report any problems:
   ```shell
   flake8 storages/
   mypy storages/
   ```
3. Run the tests and make sure that you've got 100% test coverage:
   ```shell
   pytest -n 5 --cov=storages
   ```

> **Note:** Each time you push new code to the repository a GitHub Action called `Lint and test` will be triggered.
> This action will run tests and lint your code, no surprises here üòâ.
> 
> If the linting process fails or tests wouldn't pass the whole build will fail, so please remember to go through the
> steps 1-3 and make sure that no problems are being reported to avoid these sad ‚ùå symbols next to your build.

### ‚è© Before creating a Pull Request

1. Make sure that you've maintained the 100% test coverage of the codebase.
2. Make sure you've updated the `README.md` file if there are any changes in that may make the `README.md` file obsolete.

### ‚úÖ When creating a Pull Request

1. We expect you to be as descriptive as possible when creating a pull request.
2. Please include the following information:
   - what feature is being added and what was the reasoning
   - which issues does this pull request refer to (if applicable)
3. The target branch for merging any new feature should be `staging`.
4. Remember to mark the Pull Request with a proper label.
